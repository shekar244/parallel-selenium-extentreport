Subject: Request for GitHub Copilot Access for Automation Team to Accelerate Script Development and Debugging

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I am requesting GitHub Copilot access for our entire Automation Testing team to help expedite automation script development and debugging across projects. With our growing automation workload, this tool can significantly enhance productivity and code quality.

Key benefits for our team:
	1.	Accelerated Development – Copilot’s AI-driven suggestions help generate boilerplate and framework-specific code (Selenium, Appium, Playwright, etc.) quickly, reducing repetitive work.
	2.	Faster Debugging – Real-time recommendations assist in identifying and fixing code issues faster, shortening defect resolution time.
	3.	Consistent Coding Standards – AI suggestions encourage uniform coding practices across the team, improving maintainability.
	4.	Skill Enablement – Team members can quickly explore and adopt new libraries, APIs, and best practices without long research cycles.
	5.	Improved Delivery Timelines – Less time spent on low-value coding tasks means more focus on creating robust test cases and increasing test coverage.

By providing team-wide Copilot access, we can:
	•	Standardize automation practices
	•	Reduce script development cycles
	•	Improve code reliability and maintainability
	•	Deliver test automation faster and more efficiently

We would be happy to run a short trial period and provide measurable metrics on efficiency gains, script quality improvements, and reduced debugging effort.

Thank you for considering this request, as it will directly contribute to faster releases and higher-quality automation output.

Best regards,
